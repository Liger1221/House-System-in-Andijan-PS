This line of text is a part of code.
You can't remove it, otherwise it will lead to some problems in program.
So "WARNING!" becarefull!

if you don't have "Blue" or "Green" in your school.
if it's in format of "A", "B", "C" and so on...
you can change it!

But if you change and make mistakes and program no more works its not on us!
